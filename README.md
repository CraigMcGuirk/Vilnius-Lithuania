## Home page:
* The home page contains historical facts about Vilnius old town, national and regional parks located in and around the city including facts about all 3. 

## Scenery page:
* The scenery page I have placed a multitude of images of the cities most beautiful places in my opinion. 

## Visit Vilnius:
* I have put a form including visitors to leave their name, email and a question to gauge how many people would be interested in visiting. 

## Issues incurred:

* This is my first attempt at making a website and it has been a difficult challenge for me to overcome. 

I had issues with the layout of the national parks section as it worked fine on desktop but when scaled down to mobile screen sizes the text would overlap into the box below. I fixed this issue by reducing the font size of the H3 texts.

## Features to implement in the future:

* I would like to implement activities you can take part in as there are a plethora of fun and exciting things to do in the city.

* I would also like to add a feedback section so users can input their experiences so future tourists can have the knowledge of someone who has already been for example restaurants, bars and some locations where they took some beautiful images of locations around the city.

## Testing of User Stories in UX section:
* First Time Visitor Goals

## As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to understand the purpose of the webpage and learn about Vilnius through the information provided on the pages.

* On first view of the website, the user is met with a clear and concise navigation bar which takes them to the page of their choice.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate easily around the website to find content.

* The navigation bar shows clear options in which section to go on the page. I implemented a fixed-top navigation bar which is very helpful for the user moving to another page on the site..

* At the bottom of the page, the user can view different social media accounts. The links take the user to a new tab, keeping my website open on the previous tab.

## Further Testing
* I have tested this website on the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge

## I have tested my website on the following:

* iPhone X
* iPhone 7
* iPad
* iPad Mini
* Huawei P Smart
* Huawei P30 Lite
* Samsung Laptop


* I asked Friends and Family to borrow their phone or tablet to view my website in order to test the site. I also asked for feedback and if they were able to point out any bugs or UX issues.

I tested all internal links and they worked correctly.

All external links were tested and they opened on a new tab correctly.

## Fixed Bugs: 
Menu items were not displaying correctly on smaller screen sizes, I made the font size of the page title smaller in order to give the menu items more breathing space.

## Known Bugs:

I am aware that there are some issues with text clipping into the side of the screen on screens below 350px, as a result the cover text would become slightly obscured.
